           <p>Barry Sanders (born July 16, 1968) played college football as a running back for the Oklahoma State Cowboys football team, where, as a junior in 1988 he compiled what is considered one of the greatest individual seasons in college football history, rushing for 2,850 yards and 42 touchdowns in 12 games. He won the Heisman Trophy that year as well. He still holds records for most rushing yards in a season: 2,628, the most rushing touchdowns in a season: 37, the most touchdowns in a season: 39 (tied with Montee Ball), the most games rushing for 300+ yards in a season and career: 4, the highest average rushing yards per game in a season: 238.9, and the most points scored in a season: 234.</p>
          <p>Barry played running back in the NFL for the Detroit Lions from 1989-1998. He won the rookie of the year award. During ten seasons in Detroit, he averaged over 1,500 yards rushing per season and just under 100 rushing yards per game. In 1997 he became the third player ever to rush for over 2,000 yards(2053) in a season and was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (He was co-MVP with Green Bay Quarterback Brett Favre). He has numerous records in the NFl as well, which include: most seasons with 1,100 or more Yards Rushing (10) tied with Walter Payton, most consecutive seasons with 1,100 or More Yards Rushing (10), most seasons with 1,300 or More Yards Rushing (9) tied with Walter Payton, most seasons with 1,400 or More Yards Rushing (7), most seasons with 1,500 or More Yards Rushing (5), NFL record 25 games in which he rushed for 150 yards or more, and 15 career touchdown runs of 50 yards or more, most in NFL history. He retired after ten seasons with the Lions at only the age of 30. Sanders' 15,269 career rushing yards placed him second behind Walter Payton's 16,726 yards. In 1999 he was ranked number 12 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players and he was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on January 31, 2004.</p>
